        <h3>Dynamic Routes</h3>
        <p>You can create <strong>dynamic routes</strong> by annotating a method with the
            <strong><code>@Route</code></strong> annotation. This annotation takes two parameters: the
            <strong>endpoint</strong> and the <strong>method</strong>.</p>
        <p>The <strong>endpoint</strong> represents the path that the method will respond to. For instance, if you want
            to create a dynamic route for the endpoint <code>/todos/:id</code> where <code>:id</code> is a dynamic
            parameter, you would create a method with the following signature:</p>
        <pre><code>@Route(endpoint = "/todos/:id", method = "GET")<br>public void getTodoById(Yggdrasill.RequestHandler requestHandler) {<br>    // Your code here<br>}</code></pre>
        <p>The method will be triggered when the endpoint is requested, and the method should take a single parameter,
            an instance of the <code>Yggdrasill.RequestHandler</code> class. This class provides methods to interact
            with both the request and the response.</p>

        <p>For example, to send a response with the status code <code>200 OK</code>, you would use the following code
            inside your method:</p>
        <pre><code>requestHandler.sendHTMLResponse(OK, "Todo item retrieved!");</code></pre>

        <p>In the case of dynamic routes, the <code>:id</code> parameter in the endpoint will be automatically extracted
            and passed as a part of the <code>pathParams</code> in the request handler. For example, for the endpoint
            <code>/todos/25</code>, the parameter <code>id</code> will have the value <code>25</code>.</p>

        <p><strong>Note:</strong> The dynamic route also requires the HTTP method (like <code>GET</code>,
            <code>POST</code>, <code>DELETE</code>, etc.) to be specified. This ensures that the route is triggered only
            for the correct type of request. Here's an example with a <code>DELETE</code> request to delete a todo:</p>
        <pre><code>@Route(endpoint = "/todos/:id", method = "DELETE")<br>public void getTodoById(Yggdrasill.RequestHandler requestHandler) {<br>    // Retrieve and respond with the todo<br>}</code></pre>

        <p>The <code>@Route</code> annotation can be used to map methods to specific HTTP methods like <code>GET</code>,
            <code>POST</code>, <code>PUT</code>, <code>PATCH</code>, or <code>DELETE</code>, allowing you to define
            actions for different request types on the same endpoint.</p>

        <p>For convenience, there is a folder called <strong><code>controllers</code></strong> inside the <code>src/main/java/org/ruitx/server</code>
            package. This folder contains all the controllers that handle requests. You can create a new controller by
            creating a new class in this folder and adding the <code>@Route</code> annotation to its methods.</p>

        <p><strong>Important!</strong> Don't forget to add your new controller class to the list of routes in the
            <strong><code>RoutesConfig</code></strong> configuration file located in <code>src/main/java/org/ruitx/configs/RoutesConfig</code>.
            This ensures that your dynamic routes are registered and available to the server.</p>
