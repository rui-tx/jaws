        <h3>Dynamic Routes</h3>
        <p>You can create <strong>dynamic routes</strong> by creating a controller class that extends <strong><code>Bragi</code></strong>
            and annotating its methods with the <strong><code>@Route</code></strong> annotation. This annotation takes
            two parameters: the <strong>endpoint</strong> and the <strong>method</strong>.</p>

        <p>The <strong>endpoint</strong> represents the path that the method will respond to. For instance, if you want
            to create a dynamic route for the endpoint <code>/todos/:id</code> where <code>:id</code> is a dynamic
            parameter, you would create a method with the following signature:</p>
        <pre><code>@Route(endpoint = "/todos/:id", method = "GET")
public void getTodoById() {
    String id = getPathParam("id");
    // Your code here
}</code></pre>

        <p>In the case of dynamic routes, the <code>:id</code> parameter in the endpoint will be automatically extracted
            and can be accessed using <code>getPathParam("id")</code>. For example, for the endpoint
            <code>/todos/25</code>, <code>getPathParam("id")</code> will return <code>"25"</code>.</p>

        <p><strong>Note:</strong> The dynamic route also requires the HTTP method (like <code>GET</code>,
            <code>POST</code>, <code>DELETE</code>, etc.) to be specified. This ensures that the route is triggered only
            for the correct type of request. Here's an example with a <code>DELETE</code> request to delete a todo:</p>
        <pre><code>@Route(endpoint = "/todos/:id", method = "DELETE")
public void deleteTodo() {
    String id = getPathParam("id");
    // Delete the todo and send response
    sendHTMLResponse(OK, "Todo deleted successfully!");
}</code></pre>

        <p>The <code>@Route</code> annotation can be used to map methods to specific HTTP methods like <code>GET</code>,
            <code>POST</code>, <code>PUT</code>, <code>PATCH</code>, or <code>DELETE</code>, allowing you to define
            actions for different request types on the same endpoint.</p>

        <p><strong>Important!</strong> Don't forget to add your new controller class to the list of routes in the
            <strong><code>RoutesConfig</code></strong> configuration class.
            This ensures that your dynamic routes are registered and available to the server.</p>

        <aside>All controllers should extend <strong><code>Bragi</code></strong> to take advantage of its
            thread-safe request handling and convenient methods for working with requests and responses.
